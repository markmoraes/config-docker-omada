# config-docker-omada

https://github.com/qdm12/omada has a docker-compose.yml file
in 3.0 format, but I run it on Ubuntu 16.04 (docker-compose
1.8.0-2) which only accepts a 2.0 format.  Here's my
docker-compose.yml in case it saves anyone with old Linux
some time.

The dockrun script is if one wants to start the docker by hand.
